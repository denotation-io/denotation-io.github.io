The mission of *Denotation IO* is to inform the general public about meaning, and the relation of meaning to Artificial Intelligence. 

In case you think of meaning as 'the meaning of life' or 'the meaning of a word', think again. Meaning relates to a very specific faculty of the human mind, and there is a whole science dedicated to it. If you did not know... continue reading...


## Meaning and computers: a science

Start the clock. Write down the names of as many sciences as you can. Stop the clock.

Does your list include Computational Semantics?

If not, no hard feelings. The World Wide Web would probably not have thought of it either. A search on Google News for the exact string “computational semantics” returns a feeble 80 results, some of them dating back to the early 2010s. The English Wikipedia article on Computational Semantics consists of five haphazardly written lines, copy-pasted from some long-forgotten page on the wiki of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). It provides a somewhat tedious definition, unlikely to draw a crowd:

*Computational semantics is the study of how to automate the process of constructing and reasoning with meaning representations of natural language expressions.*

Tellingly, the last event in the life of the original ACL page involved being defaced by a sports gambling site from Thailand, on June 25th, 2012. The changes were admittedly reverted four hours later by an administrator. But since then, no update, no news. As if this bizarre little field of study had been frozen in time. 

You could be forgiven for thinking that Computational Semantics sounds like a niche interest. But nothing would be further from the truth. In sharp contrast with the results given by Google News and Wikipedia, Google Scholar yields over 16,000 scientific articles on the topic, published by hundreds of research labs across the globe. 1700 of those have appeared in the last year alone, reflecting the importance of the field in industrial contexts. Well-known applications such as Google Search, Siri, Amazon Alexa, as well as that annoying chatbot on your bank’s website, are entirely reliant on their semantic component. Corporations are more and more invested in building larger and better models of meaning, spending huge amounts on both hardware and human resources. The energy cost of this race has in fact become so high that the scientific community is starting to be concerned by the CO2 emissions it generates. Meaning – and not data, as some would have it – is the new oil.

The difference between data and meaning is similar to the difference between petroleum reservoirs and refined oil. It is advantageous for governments and companies to own or control land containing crude oil, but without the equipment and know-how to extract and refine the hydrocarbons, there is nothing to sell to consumers. So large corporations like Total, BP and Exxon Mobil invest millions in technologies to locate, extract and prepare oil for consumption. Similarly, owning large amounts of data supposedly gives companies an edge in the new ‘digital age’. But without techniques and people to turn that data into the fuel of machine learning algorithms, the edge is lost. 

When petrochemists refine crude oil, they look for certain properties in the extracted substance: purity and stability, for instance. Data, too, is only really useful if it can be refined into a special kind of artificial substance which exhibits certain properties and ideally agrees with human behaviour, or even better, can be directly mapped to the electrical activity of the brain. In the same way that Total and BP need the fundamental science of chemistry to understand the behaviour of hydrocarbons, Google and Amazon need a fundamental science that explains how the mind represents the raw data it receives from the world and interprets its representations.

As it happens, semantics – the science of meaning – does just that. For humans, meaning is the glue binding the world around us and turning it into a structured collection of manipulable mental objects which we can name, describe, and combine into novel ideas. The natural phenomenon has evolved to encode just the right properties: our semantic faculty lets us map anything from single objects to events, relationships and entire narratives into brain activity. The representations obtained through this process are highly versatile, amenable both to the wild associations of poetry and the logical arguments of science. They are at the source of all human thoughts and underlie everything that our species has ever done.

So if meaning is so important, why have you never heard about it? Why do corporations currently advertise their latest AIs in terms of ‘general intelligence’, ‘problem solving’, or even ‘machine consciousness’, and not in terms of semantics? For the same reason that BP sells ‘gasoline’ and that you put ‘petrol’ or ‘gas’ in your car rather than a mix of ‘paraffins’, ‘olefins’ and ‘cycloalkanes’. For the very reason that makes it possible for thousands of people to be employed in the car industry, including in technical jobs, without knowing what 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane is (an organic compound that makes it less likely that your vehicle will go up in flames when you turn on the engine).

Engineering is not science.

While engineers busy themselves with building new technologies out of the resources found in the natural world, scientists attempt to elucidate the structure of nature itself. Engineering tends to be more attractive than science: a fast car elegantly following the curves of a road makes more of an impression than the sticky black stuff coming out of an oil rig, let alone its chemical formula. And still, without nature, there would be no human artefact.

*Denotation IO* is an invitation to look beyond the colourful Formula Ones of Artificial Intelligence and take a trip into their combustion engines, all the way down to the hydrocarbons that power their pistons. There, the reader will find the dry natural phenomenon without which no intelligence would emerge. It is called meaning and its formula has not yet been fully discovered.
